# Sniping

This repository describes an experimental automation pipeline aimed at quickly securing limited-availability resources. It provides a basic framework for monitoring a target and automatically acting once predefined conditions are met. The project is currently **experimental** and should not be considered production-ready.

## Project Description

The pipeline focuses on tasks where timing is critical, such as purchasing rare items or booking limited slots as soon as they become available. Users can adapt the framework to their own targets by defining the monitoring logic and the action to perform when a match is detected.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies when they are added to `requirements.txt`.
4. Configure your target parameters in `config.yml` or a similar configuration file.

## Usage

Run the sniping script with your configuration once it has been implemented:

```bash
python snipe.py --config config.yml
```

The script will monitor the specified target and attempt the automated action when the desired conditions are met. Because the project is experimental, expect that functionality may change and that manual supervision is advised.

## Status

This automation pipeline is currently **experimental**. Contributions are welcome to help mature the project.
